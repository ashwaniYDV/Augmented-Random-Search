# Augmented Random Search
Augmented Random Search is a game changing AI. It is very simple implementation it is able to do the exactly the same thing that Google Deepmind did in there accomplishment last year which is to which is to train an AI to workand run across a field. Augmented Random Search is 100x time faster and 100x time more powerful.

The best part is that with augmented random search is no need for complex Algorithms or Framework such as Tensorflow or PyTorch.
This is the best AI in 2018.
